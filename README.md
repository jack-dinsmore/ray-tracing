# Ray-tracing
Ray tracing projects for astrophysical situations

## Directories
* **black_hole**: ray tracing code for a general relativistic spacetime

## To do
* Code breaks when I consider non-radial photons. A problem with Christoffel symbol code?
* No longer make the photons field of views public.
* Galaxy skybox
